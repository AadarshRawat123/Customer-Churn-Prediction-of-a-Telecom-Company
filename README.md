Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company

Project Overview:-

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning models. 
The model will help the company identify which customers are likely to churn, allowing them to take proactive measures to improve customer retention.
By analyzing historical customer data, we seek to provide insights into the key factors influencing churn and develop a strategy for reducing it.

Problem Statement:-

The telecom company is facing a high rate of customer churn, resulting in revenue loss. 
The company wants to identify customers likely to churn and understand the factors contributing to churn so they can implement retention strategies.

Objectives:-

Identify the key features contributing to customer churn.
Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Data:-

The dataset contains customer information, including usage patterns, demographic data, and subscription details. 
The data has been split into training and testing sets for model building and evaluation.

Training Data: Historical customer data with churn labels.
Testing Data: Unlabeled customer data for churn prediction.

Key features include:-

Customer ID
Tenure
Monthly charges
Total charges
Contract type
Payment method
Internet service type
Additional services (streaming, tech support, etc.)


Key Tasks:-

Data Analysis: Analyze historical customer data, including usage patterns and demographics.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: Identify relevant features that may impact churn.
Model Building: Develop a machine learning model to predict churn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Recommendations: Provide recommendations based on the model's insights to help reduce churn.


Methodology:-

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Univariate and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between features and customer churn.
Data Preprocessing: Imputation of missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Development: Implemented classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Model Evaluation: Performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
